# BASSics

## BASSics is an app for bass guitar students. It features an interactive fretboard that users can click and "play" the bass. For those who still struggle with note names and their location on the fretboard, there is a quiz game to test your knowledge. Additionally, if minor and major scales are still a challenge, you can pick a key and see a visualization of how to play it on the bass.
